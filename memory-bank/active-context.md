# Active Context

## Current Task
**Enhancing Roo Configuration for Agentic Work**
- Started: December 26, 2024
- Mode: Architect
- Priority: High
- Status: Near Completion

## Task Objectives
1. ✅ Update configuration for Bun ecosystem
2. ✅ Correct domain migration references
3. ✅ Establish Memory Bank system
4. ✅ Enhance inter-agent collaboration
5. ✅ Create specialized modes for KBE project

## Recent Changes
- Project migrated from npm to Bun
- Domain changed from homerconnect.com to homerenrichment.com
- Firebase App Hosting deployed
- Biome linter adopted (replacing ESLint/Prettier)
- Vitest testing framework configured
- Memory Bank system fully initialized
- AGENTS.md updated with current stack

## Key Decisions Made
1. Memory Bank structure defined with 6 core files
2. Enhancement plan created with 4-phase approach
3. New specialized modes identified (Performance, Migration)
4. Inter-agent handoff protocol designed
5. All documentation updated to reflect current state

## Critical Auth Issue Context
**Firebase Auth Configuration Challenge**
- App deployed on Vercel: kbe-website.vercel.app
- Auth errors on both desktop and mobile
- Root cause: Firebase project/domain mismatch
- Solution approach: 10-minute fix protocol documented

### Key Auth Requirements
1. Firebase config must match across all environments
2. Authorized domains must be in correct Firebase project
3. API key restrictions must include all domains
4. authDomain pattern must be consistent

## Active Files
- `roo-enhancement-plan.md` - Master enhancement strategy
- `memory-bank/*` - All 6 core files created
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated with Bun and current stack
- `agentic-workflow-summary.md` - Complete summary
- `.clinerules-*` files - Mode configurations reviewed

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Memory Bank fully initialized
2. ✅ AGENTS.md updated with Bun commands
3. ✅ System patterns documented
4. ✅ Agent handoffs template created
5. ✅ Workflow summary documented

## Open Questions
- Should we document the auth fix workflow in system-patterns.md?
- How to handle Vercel vs Firebase hosting considerations?
- Best approach for environment variable management?

## Dependencies
- Bun 1.2.21+ installed and configured
- Firebase project access maintained
- Domain migration completed
- Vercel deployment active

## Context for Next Session
The Roo configuration enhancement is complete. Memory Bank system is active and all documentation has been updated to reflect the current project state with Bun, Biome, Vitest, and the new domain. The auth workflow shared indicates there's an active authentication issue that needs resolution following the 10-minute fix protocol.
