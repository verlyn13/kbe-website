## Collaboration Patterns

### 1. Implementation Flow
```
Architect → Code → Test → Deploy
    ↓         ↓      ↓
  Debug ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```

### 2. Bug Fix Flow
```
User Report → Debug → Code → Test → Architect (review)
```

### 3. Feature Development Flow
```
Architect (design) → Code (implement) → Test (validate) →
Debug (if needed) → Code (fix) → Test (verify) → Complete
```

### 4. Documentation Flow
```
Any Mode → Ask (clarify) → Architect (document) → Complete
```

## Mode Capabilities Reference

### Architect Mode
- ✅ Read all files
- ✅ Create/modify *.md files
- ✅ Design systems
- ✅ Plan implementations
- ❌ Modify code files

### Code Mode
- ✅ Read all files
- ✅ Modify all code files
- ✅ Run commands
- ✅ Test implementations
- ❌ Modify architecture docs

### Debug Mode
- ✅ Read all files
- ✅ Run diagnostic commands
- ✅ Analyze issues
- ❌ Modify files (except during UMB)
- ✅ Identify root causes

### Test Mode
- ✅ Read all files
- ✅ Run test commands
- ✅ Analyze coverage
- ❌ Modify files (except during UMB)
- ✅ Validate implementations

### Ask Mode
- ✅ Read all files
- ✅ Provide explanations
- ✅ Clarify requirements
- ❌ Modify files
- ✅ Guide decisions

---

## Handoff Best Practices

### DO's
- ✅ Always specify success criteria
- ✅ Reference relevant Memory Bank files
- ✅ Provide clear context
- ✅ Define rollback conditions
- ✅ Update Memory Bank after handoff

### DON'Ts
- ❌ Handoff without clear requirements
- ❌ Assume context is understood
- ❌ Skip validation steps
- ❌ Ignore mode restrictions
- ❌ Forget to document decisions

---

## Performance Metrics

### Handoff Success Rate
- **Target**: 95%
- **Current**: N/A (New system)
- **Measurement**: Successful completions / Total handoffs

### Context Retention
- **Target**: 90%
- **Current**: N/A (New system)
- **Measurement**: Information preserved / Information needed

### Task Completion Time
- **Baseline**: To be established
- **Target**: 30% improvement
- **Measurement**: Average time per task type

---

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Mode Confusion
- Switch to Ask mode for clarification
- Review Memory Bank context
- Retry with correct mode

### Level 2: Repeated Failures
- Switch to Debug mode for analysis
- Document issue in decision-log.md
- Escalate to Architect for design review

### Level 3: System Issues
- Document in progress.md
- Alert user for manual intervention
- Create recovery plan

---

## Communication Protocols

### Synchronous Handoffs
Used for immediate transitions within same session
- Direct mode switch
- Context passed via active-context.md
- Immediate acknowledgment required

### Asynchronous Handoffs
Used for transitions between sessions
- Full context in Memory Bank
- Detailed requirements in agent-handoffs.md
- Can be picked up by any agent

---

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Task clearly defined
- [ ] Success criteria specified
- [ ] Context documented
- [ ] Memory Bank updated
- [ ] Mode capabilities verified

### Post-Handoff Validation
- [ ] Target mode acknowledged
- [ ] Context understood
- [ ] Requirements clear
- [ ] Work commenced
- [ ] Progress tracked

---

## Training Notes

### For New Agents
1. Always read Memory Bank on session start
2. Check agent-handoffs.md for pending work
3. Update progress.md regularly
4. Document decisions in decision-log.md
5. Use system-patterns.md for consistency

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to check Memory Bank
- Not updating progress tracking
- Skipping validation steps
- Ignoring mode restrictions
- Poor handoff documentation

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Automated handoff validation
2. Context compression for large projects
3. Multi-agent parallel processing
4. Intelligent mode routing
5. Performance analytics dashboard

### Experimental Features
- Cross-project pattern learning
- Predictive handoff suggestions
- Automatic context summarization
- Error pattern recognition
- Adaptive mode selection
