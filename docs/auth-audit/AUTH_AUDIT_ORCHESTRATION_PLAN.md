## Addendum — Verification Notes (August 26, 2025)

The following items were cross-checked in the codebase to validate audit assumptions. This addendum is source-of-truth for what is present in `src/` and `lib/` at this time.

### Phase 1: Configuration Auditor (Evidence from Repo)
- Env var names and usage confirmed in `src/lib/firebase.ts`. Actual values and console-side settings (authorized domains, redirect URIs, App Check enforcement) cannot be verified from code alone.
- reCAPTCHA Enterprise key referenced in `RECAPTCHA_KEY_CORRECTION.md` matches the “correct key” cited in the report; ensure the environment binds this value.

### Phase 2: Code Implementation Validator (Findings)
- Firebase setup: `src/lib/firebase.ts` implements singleton init, session-only persistence, and App Check client init. Pass (code-level).
- Auth service layer: Not present; logic resides in `src/components/login-form.tsx`. Fail (relative to documented architecture).
- OAuth mobile handling: `LoginForm` uses `signInWithPopup` unconditionally. No redirect fallback in main flow. Likely to fail on mobile; add device detection + `signInWithRedirect`. Fail.
- Magic link flow: Link generator uses `url: ${window.location.origin}/` (root), but completion logic runs only when `LoginForm` is mounted at `/login`. Root page (`src/app/page.tsx`) lacks magic-link handling. This is a concrete gap to address by changing the URL to `/login` or handling magic links at root. Fail.
- Error handling: Zod + toast messages present; logging uses `logger` (dev-only output) and some direct `console.*` (runs in prod) in `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`. Partial.
- CSRF: No explicit app-level CSRF; note Firebase SDK manages OAuth `state`. Consider reclassifying severity; not a typical client-only CSRF exposure. Partial.
- Rate limiting: None in client. Firebase applies server-side quotas; client backoff is recommended for UX. Partial.

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing Engineer (Repo Signals)
- No integrated E2E auth tests present. A diagnostics page exists at `/auth-diagnostics` that allows manual popup/redirect testing and App Check checks.
- Timings and mobile popup-blocking behavior cannot be verified from static code; requires runtime validation.

### Verification Checkpoint Summaries
```yaml
Configuration Status:
  firebase_providers: unknown (console-only)
  oauth_configuration: unknown (console-only)
  environment_variables: pass (names/usage only; values unknown)
  domain_setup: unknown (console-only)
  discrepancies_found:
    - magic_link_landing_mismatch
    - missing_service_layer
    - no_mobile_redirect_fallback
  critical_issues:
    - mobile_oauth_popup_only

Code Implementation Status:
  firebase_setup: pass
  auth_service: fail (not present)
  react_integration: pass (context/provider present)
  auth_pages: partial (no /auth/*; /login only)
  security_practices: partial (SDK-managed state; logging in prod)
  code_issues:
    - console_logs_in_prod (src/hooks/use-auth.tsx)
  missing_implementations:
    - redirect_fallback_for_mobile
    - magic_link_handler_on_root_or_url_fix

Testing Status:
  email_password: untested (repo-only)
  google_oauth: untested (repo-only)
  magic_link: untested (repo-only)
  cross_browser: untested
  error_handling: partial (unit/UI only)
  performance: unknown
```

### Concrete File References
- `src/components/login-form.tsx` (all auth methods; popup-only Google; magic-link URL -> `/`).
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` (env usage; App Check init; session persistence).
- `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` (auth state; unconditional console logging).
- `src/app/page.tsx` (no magic-link completion logic).
- `src/app/auth-diagnostics/page.tsx` (manual testing for popup/redirect; not wired in main flow).

### Recommended Documentation Updates
- Reflect the current `/login`-centric implementation and absence of a service layer.
- Document mobile redirect fallback requirement in the main login flow (not only diagnostics).
- Clarify that CSRF “state” is managed by Firebase SDK and that client-only apps rely on server-side Firebase quotas for rate limiting.
