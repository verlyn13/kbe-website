- **0 files** in quarantine
- Proper detection of API keys, tokens, passwords

## Phase 2: Rehydrate the Canon [PARTIALLY COMPLETE ~60%]

### Core Canonical Docs Status

| Document | Requirements | Status | Assessment |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| `ops/deploy.md` | Vercel flow, preview/prod, build steps | ✅ EXISTS | Basic content present, needs Vercel Env mapping details |
| `ops/cloudflare.md` | DNS records, SSL mode, NO Workers/Pages | ✅ EXISTS | Good DNS-only focus, complete |
| `dev/environment.md` | Full env table, source mapping, load order | ✅ EXISTS | Well-structured env table with sources |
| `dev/secrets-gopass.md` | Paths, get/insert commands, rotation | ✅ EXISTS | Comprehensive gopass paths documented |
| `dev/database.md` | Prisma workflow, migration policy, seeding | ✅ EXISTS | Complete workflow documented |
| `api/auth.md` | Supabase providers, redirect origins, RLS | ✅ EXISTS | Supabase auth configuration present |
| `dev/tools.md` | VS Code, Claude/MCP, Codex config | ✅ EXISTS | VS Code and Claude config documented |
| `dev/config-registry.md` | Complete index of config files | ✅ EXISTS | Comprehensive registry with ownership |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System overview with diagrams | ✅ EXISTS | Basic architecture documented |
| `docs/changelog.md` | Change tracking | ✅ EXISTS | Active changelog maintained |

### Additional Structure Created
- ✅ `docs/_generated/` directory with placeholder for Supabase types
- ✅ `docs/decisions/` with ADR template
- ✅ `docs/migration/` with comprehensive tracking
- ✅ CI guard scripts in `scripts/`:
  - `check-legacy-config.sh`
  - `check-env-files.sh`
  - `check-types.sh`
  - `check-dx-syntax.sh`
  - `check-dx-policy.sh`

### Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
1. **Core docs exist**: All 8 priority canonical docs are present
2. **Clear stack definition**: Vercel + Supabase + Prisma + Bun clearly documented
3. **Good separation**: Legacy Firebase clearly marked as removed
4. **CI guards implemented**: Security scripts ready for CI/CD
5. **Config registry complete**: All config files indexed with ownership

#### Areas Needing Completion
1. **Supabase types**: Still using placeholder, needs actual generation
2. **Runbooks missing**: `ops/runbooks/` exists but key runbooks not written
3. **Some docs sparse**: Several canonical docs need more detail
4. **KEEP files not merged**: 152 KEEP files still in archive, not merged

## Shortcuts and Issues Found

### ⚠️ Potential Shortcuts Identified

1. **Supabase Types Placeholder**
   - `docs/_generated/supabase-types.ts` is a manual placeholder
   - Should be auto-generated from actual Supabase schema
   - Risk: Type mismatches between code and database

2. **Incomplete KEEP File Processing**
   - 152 files marked as KEEP but not merged into canonical docs
   - Many valuable content pieces still buried in archive
   - Risk: Important information not accessible

3. **Missing Runbooks**
   - Directory exists but critical runbooks not written:
     - auth-errors.md
     - database-migration.md
     - supabase-policies.md
     - cold-starts-ssr.md
   - Risk: No playbooks for common operational issues

4. **Incomplete Merge Strategy**
   - MAYBE files (88 total) not triaged
   - No clear plan for consolidating duplicate content
   - Risk: Information fragmentation

### ✅ No Critical Shortcuts Found

Despite incomplete areas, no dangerous shortcuts were taken:
- Archive structure is properly organized
- Classification tools work correctly
- Core canonical docs exist with reasonable content
- Security considerations properly flagged
- CI guard scripts implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Process KEEP files**: Start merging the 152 KEEP files into canonical docs
2. **Generate Supabase types**: Connect to Supabase and generate actual types
3. **Write critical runbooks**: At minimum create auth-errors and database-migration

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Triage MAYBE files**: Review and decide on 88 MAYBE files
2. **Enhance sparse docs**: Add more detail to existing canonical docs
3. **Test CI guards**: Ensure all check scripts work in CI pipeline

### Medium Term (Two Weeks)
1. **Complete all runbooks**: Fill out ops/runbooks/ directory
2. **Archive cleanup**: Remove DELETE-tagged files
3. **Documentation review**: Full review of canonical docs for completeness

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 and 1b are FULLY COMPLETE** without shortcuts. The archive structure is well-organized, and the classification tools are functional and producing useful output.

**Phase 2 is PARTIALLY COMPLETE (~60%)** with the foundation laid but significant work remaining:
- All core canonical docs exist but need enhancement
- 152 KEEP files await merging
- Critical runbooks are missing
- Supabase types need proper generation

The migration has been executed professionally with no dangerous shortcuts, but Phase 2 requires focused effort to reach completion. The project has a solid documentation foundation that needs refinement rather than rework.

## DocOps Enhancement Status [NEW]

### Advanced Tooling Added
✅ **doc-exec.ts** - Executable documentation harness
- Scans for code blocks marked `testable`
- Supports safe execution with DRY_RUN=1 default
- Network/install commands blocked unless `allow-net` tag present
- Fixed argument parsing bug (was converting boolean to string)
- Currently finds 0 testable blocks (none marked yet)

✅ **doc-watch.ts** - Fact drift monitoring
- Monitors 6 official documentation sources
- Supports dry-run mode (default in CI)
- Can perform HEAD requests to check ETag/Last-Modified
- Fixed argument parsing bug
- Configuration validated with proper URLs

✅ **docs-metrics.ts** - Documentation quality metrics
- Scans for frontmatter (status, owner, last_verified)
- Currently reports 243 files, all without frontmatter (expected)
- Fixed argument parsing bug
- Generates JSON and Markdown reports

✅ **fact-watch.json** - Official source watchlist
```json
{
  "sources": [
    "https://nextjs.org/docs",
    "https://vercel.com/docs", 
    "https://supabase.com/docs",
    "https://www.prisma.io/docs",
    "https://tailwindcss.com/docs",
    "https://bun.sh/docs"
  ]
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
✅ **GitHub Workflows**
- `.github/workflows/docops.yml` - Main workflow with safe defaults
- `.github/workflows/docops-watch-live.yml` - Manual trigger for live fact checking
- All tools run in read-only/dry-run mode by default

### Package.json Scripts
✅ **Working Scripts** (after fixes):
- `docs:exec` - Scan for testable blocks
- `docs:exec:run` - Execute testable blocks (with safety)
- `docs:watch` - Check fact drift (dry-run)
- `docs:metrics` - Generate quality metrics
- `docs:classify` - Classify documents (existing)
- `docs:dashboard` - Generate triage dashboard (existing)
- `docs:triage` - Combined classify + dashboard

### Quality Assessment
- **Tool Implementation**: Professional, with proper safety guards
- **Argument Parsing**: Had bugs, now fixed across all tools
- **Security**: Excellent - DRY_RUN default, network blocking, sandboxing
- **Integration**: Well-integrated with existing classifier/dashboard
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive process-docs.md with ambitious roadmap
