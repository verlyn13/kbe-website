# Phase 1: Inventory & Freeze - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully archived **257 markdown documentation files** from across the entire project into `docs/archive/`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Archive Structure
Created 32+ subdirectories in `docs/archive/` organized by topic:
- api, audits, auth, biome, cloudflare, code-quality
- configuration, database, deployment, development
- firebase, fixes, linting, migration-notes
- orchestration, refactoring, secrets, setup, testing
- And many more...

### 2. Moved All Documentation
- **Root directory**: 59 files initially found and moved
- **Hidden directories**: .claude, .codex, .roo, .github configs
- **Main docs directory**: 50+ files from docs/ 
- **Backups directory**: Historical migration files from August 2025
- **Subdirectories**: auth-audit, legacy-firebase, etc.
- **Legacy-firebase directory**: 28 additional files from docs/legacy-firebase/
- **Total archived**: 257 markdown files

### 3. Created Migration Index
Created `docs/migration/index.md` with triage tags for all files:
- **KEEP**: 9 files (will become new canonical docs)
- **MERGE**: 11 files (content to be consolidated)
- **ARCHIVE**: 21 files (historical reference)
- **DELETE**: 18+ files (no longer needed)

### 4. Added Tombstone Notes
Added archive notices to high-traffic files pointing to future canonical locations:
- `DEPLOYMENT_METHOD.md` → future `docs/ops/deploy.md`
- `LINTING_STRATEGY.md` → future `docs/_contributing/linting.md`
- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → future `docs/dev/setup.md`
- `DATABASE_DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md` → future `docs/dev/database.md`

## Files Preserved at Root
These files remain at root as they are actively used:
- **README.md** - Main project readme
- **CLAUDE.md** - Claude Code instructions (active)
- **AGENTS.md** - Agent team configuration (active)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
As defined in `docs/archive/migration-notes/docs-migration.md`:

Priority files to create/rehydrate:
1. `docs/architecture.md` - System overview
2. `docs/dev/environment.md` - Environment variables table
3. `docs/dev/secrets-gopass.md` - Secret management
4. `docs/dev/database.md` - Prisma workflow
5. `docs/ops/deploy.md` - Deployment process
6. `docs/api/auth.md` - Authentication story

## Migration Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Inventory & Freeze (Complete)
- ⏳ Phase 2: Rehydrate the Canon (Ready to start)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Runbooks & Edges (Future)
