# Sprint Summary: OAuth Authentication Issues
## Date: August 26, 2025

---

## Sprint Objectives
1. Fix mobile OAuth redirect failure
2. Investigate and resolve authentication flow issues  
3. Prepare for potential platform migration

---

## Key Discoveries

### Root Cause Identified: `/n/` Path Injection
- **Issue**: Firebase OAuth redirects to `/n/__/auth/handler` instead of `/__/auth/handler`
- **Impact**: 404 errors break mobile authentication completely
- **Source**: Firebase App Hosting infrastructure (not in our code)
- **Evidence**: No `/n/` references found anywhere in codebase

### Firebase Configuration Issues
1. **Domain Mismatch**: Auth domain set to `kbe-website.firebaseapp.com` while app runs on `homerenrichment.com`
2. **App Check Conflict**: Must remain "unenforced" for OAuth to work
3. **Cross-Domain State Loss**: OAuth state doesn't persist across domain redirects

---

## Work Completed

### Code Changes
- ✅ Implemented unconditional OAuth redirect checking
- ✅ Added mobile-specific persistence (browserLocalPersistence)
- ✅ Fixed magic link button responsiveness
- ✅ Removed all debug code for production readiness
- ✅ Updated Firebase authDomain configuration

### Documentation Created
- ✅ `VERCEL_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete migration guide
- ✅ `DOMAIN_FIX_STEPS.md` - OAuth configuration documentation
- ✅ Updated `CODE_QUALITY_STATUS.md` 

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All 179 files pass Biome linting
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ All 13 tests passing
- ✅ Clean commit history maintained

---

## Current Status

### What Works
- ✅ Desktop OAuth authentication
- ✅ Email/password authentication
- ✅ Magic link authentication (email)
- ✅ Protected routes and authorization
- ✅ Firestore data access
- ✅ App Check integration (unenforced mode)

### What's Broken
- ❌ Mobile OAuth redirect (404 on `/n/__/auth/handler`)
- ❌ App Check enforcement (must stay disabled)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Migrate to Vercel (RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Benefits**:
- Fixes OAuth `/n/` path issue immediately
- Better debugging and error tracking
- Faster deployments (1-2 min vs 3-5 min)
- No Firebase App Hosting complexity

**Action Items**:
1. Use `VERCEL_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` as guide
2. Copy environment variables from Google Secret Manager
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Update DNS records
5. Test mobile OAuth (should work immediately)

### Option 2: Stay on Firebase App Hosting
**Timeline**: Unknown (waiting for Firebase fix)
**Current Workarounds**:
- Desktop-only OAuth
- Email/password for mobile users
- Magic links as alternative

**Risks**:
- Mobile OAuth remains broken indefinitely
- `/n/` path issue is infrastructure-level (we can't fix it)
- Poor mobile user experience

## Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Files**: 179 total
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000
- **Test Coverage**: 13 tests across 6 suites
- **Type Safety**: 100% (no TypeScript errors)
- **Linting**: 100% clean

### Performance
- **Build Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Deploy Time**: 3-5 minutes (Firebase App Hosting)
- **Bundle Size**: ~221 KB First Load JS

### Issues
- **P0 Bugs**: 1 (Mobile OAuth)
- **P1 Bugs**: 1 (App Check enforcement)
- **Technical Debt**: Minimal

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Firebase App Hosting Limitations**: The `/n/` path injection is undocumented and appears to be specific to how Firebase App Hosting handles Next.js apps.

2. **Domain Configuration Complexity**: Firebase Auth requires careful coordination between authDomain, authorized domains, and OAuth redirect URIs.

3. **Mobile vs Desktop Differences**: OAuth redirect flow behaves differently on mobile, requiring special persistence handling.

4. **Debugging Infrastructure Issues**: Some problems exist at the platform level and can't be fixed in application code.

---

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Systematic debugging approach identified root cause
- Clean code practices maintained throughout
- Comprehensive documentation created
- All quality checks passing

### What Could Be Improved
- Earlier recognition that issue was infrastructure-level
- Could have tested on actual mobile device sooner
- Migration option should have been considered earlier

### Action Items for Next Sprint
1. **DECIDE**: Vercel migration or continue with Firebase
2. **If migrating**: Execute migration checklist
3. **If staying**: Implement better mobile fallbacks
4. **Either way**: Re-enable App Check enforcement after fixing OAuth
