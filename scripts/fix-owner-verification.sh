echo "========================================="
echo ""

echo "The OAuth consent screen shows 'no reachable owners/editors' even though"
echo "jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com is listed as Owner."
echo ""

echo "POSSIBLE CAUSES & FIXES:"
echo "----------------------"
echo ""

echo "1. EMAIL VERIFICATION ISSUE"
echo "   - Is jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com verified?"
echo "   - Can you receive emails at this address?"
echo "   - Check spam folder for Google verification emails"
echo ""

echo "2. ADD SECONDARY OWNER"
echo "   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=kbe-website"
echo "   - Add another email you control as Owner"
echo "   - This can help bypass the verification issue"
echo ""

echo "3. CHECK OAUTH APP CONFIGURATION"
echo "   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=kbe-website"
echo "   - Click 'EDIT APP'"
echo "   - Under 'User support email', select jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com"
echo "   - Under 'Developer contact information', add jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com"
echo "   - Save changes"
echo ""

echo "4. VERIFY BILLING ACCOUNT"
echo "   The OAuth screen shows billing is verified ‚úì"
echo "   But double-check: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing?project=kbe-website"
echo ""

echo "5. CHECK AUTHORIZED DOMAINS"
echo "   You're missing this domain in Firebase Auth settings:"
echo "   - kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app"
echo "   "
echo "   Add it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kbe-website/authentication/settings"
echo ""

echo "6. TEMPORARY WORKAROUND - TEST MODE"
echo "   If nothing else works:"
echo "   1. Change OAuth consent to 'Testing' mode"
echo "   2. Add jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com as test user"
echo "   3. This limits to 100 users but unblocks auth"
echo ""

echo "CHECKING CURRENT AUTH STATUS..."

# Test if the API is responding at all

echo "If you see 'Permission denied' above, the owner verification is the issue."
echo "If you see project config, then auth should be working."
