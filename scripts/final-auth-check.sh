echo "CRITICAL: Even after all fixes, if Google Sign-in still doesn't work,"
echo "there might be a fundamental issue with the OAuth implementation."

echo "Alternative Solution: Enhanced Magic Link Authentication"
echo "------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Since we confirmed email/password auth works perfectly,"
echo "consider using magic links as the primary authentication method:"
echo ""
echo "Benefits:"
echo "✓ No OAuth complexity"
echo "✓ Works on all domains immediately"
echo "✓ Better mobile experience"
echo "✓ No popup blockers"
echo "✓ More secure (no passwords)"
echo ""

echo "Quick Implementation Check:"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "1. Magic link auth is already implemented"
echo "2. Email templates are created"
echo "3. Just need to make it more prominent on login page"
echo ""

echo "To enhance the login experience:"
echo "1. Make 'Sign in with Email' the primary button"
echo "2. Move 'Sign in with Google' below as secondary"
echo "3. Add helpful text: 'We'll send you a secure login link'"
echo ""

echo "Testing Magic Link Flow:"
echo "-----------------------"

TEST_EMAIL="test-$(date +%s)@example.com"

  -H "Referer: https://homerenrichment.com" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"$TEST_EMAIL\",\"password\":\"$(openssl rand -base64 12)\",\"returnSecureToken\":true}" 2>&1)

    echo "✅ Email/Password auth is working perfectly!"

echo ""
echo "Recommendation:"
echo "--------------"
echo "While we wait for the authDomain fix to deploy and propagate,"
echo "you can immediately use magic link authentication which is"
echo "already working and provides a better user experience."
