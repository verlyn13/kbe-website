# Check These Firebase Authentication Settings

Since domains are already authorized, check these other settings that could block authentication:

## 1. **Sign-up Quota** (MOST LIKELY)
- Go to: Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Sign-up quota
- Check if you've hit the daily quota limit
- Default is often 100 sign-ups per day
- If at limit, increase it or disable quota

## 2. **Blocking Functions**
- Go to: Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Blocking functions
- Check if any blocking functions are configured
- These can block sign-ins based on custom logic

## 3. **User Actions**
- Go to: Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → User actions
- Check if "Email enumeration protection" is enabled
- This can interfere with magic links

## 4. **SMS Region Policy**
- Even though not using SMS, check if there are region restrictions
- Go to: Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → SMS region policy

## 5. **reCAPTCHA / Fraud Prevention**
- Go to: Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Fraud prevention
- Check if reCAPTCHA enforcement is blocking requests
- Try toggling it off temporarily

## 6. **App Hosting Specific Issue**
The domain `kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app` is missing from your authorized domains list!
- Add: `kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app`
- This is your App Hosting URL and needs to be authorized

## Quick Test
After checking these settings, test authentication from:
1. https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app (App Hosting URL)
2. https://homerconnect.com (Custom domain)

## Most Common Culprits:
1. **Sign-up quota exceeded** - Check and increase limit
2. **Missing App Hosting domain** - Add the .hosted.app domain
3. **Email enumeration protection** - Can block magic links
4. **Blocking functions** - May have custom rules
