# Production Authentication Fix

## Root Cause Found!

Production was using the WRONG API key from Google Cloud secrets:

- **Was using**: `AIzaSyDfdjr_iinFWAMwoM2co4gHzlGmSoGkZIM` (Generative Language API Key)
- **Should use**: `AIzaSyBhTEs3Uxq_KBLBzbzIL2VB4Ao_DBw9faM` (Browser API Key)

## What We Fixed:

1. **Local Development** (âœ… WORKING)
   - Updated `.env.local` to use correct Browser API key
   - Updated authDomain to `kbe-website.firebaseapp.com`
   - Both Google Sign-in and Magic Links now work locally

2. **Production** (ðŸš€ DEPLOYING)
   - Updated Google Cloud secret `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` to correct value
   - Created new rollout to deploy with updated secret
   - Deployment in progress at: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kbe-website/apphosting

## Timeline:

- Secret updated: Just now
- Rollout started: In progress
- Expected completion: 5-10 minutes
- Test at: https://homerconnect.com

## Why This Happened:

Your `apphosting.yaml` pulls Firebase config from Google Cloud secrets. The secret contained the wrong API key (Generative Language API instead of Browser API).

## To Verify Once Deployed:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Visit https://homerconnect.com
3. Try Google Sign-in - it should work!
4. Try Magic Link - it should also work!

## Important Note:

The `.env.local` file mentions it was "Generated from Google Cloud secrets". You may want to update whatever process generates that file to use the correct API key.
