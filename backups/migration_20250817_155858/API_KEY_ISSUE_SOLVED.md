# API Key Issue SOLVED!

## The Problem

Your `.env.local` file was using:

- Wrong API key: `AIzaSyCQfj7TpHnoB2TdaBmM06wG8L2-hwHmikc` (Firebase API Key)
- Wrong authDomain: `homerconnect.com`

## The Solution

Updated `.env.local` to use:

- Correct API key: `AIzaSyBhTEs3Uxq_KBLBzbzIL2VB4Ao_DBw9faM` (Browser API Key)
- Correct authDomain: `kbe-website.firebaseapp.com`

## Why This Matters

1. The "Firebase API Key" might not have the same OAuth client configuration
2. The Browser API key was specifically created by Firebase for web authentication
3. The authDomain MUST be the Firebase domain for OAuth to work properly

## Test Now

1. If dev server is running, restart it to pick up new env variables
2. Test at http://localhost:9002
3. Both Google Sign-in and Magic Links should work

## For Production

The deployment uses the hardcoded values in `firebase.ts`, which are already correct.
The issue was only affecting local development due to `.env.local` overrides.

## Important Note

Your `.env.local` appears to be generated from Google Cloud secrets. You may need to update the source of these secrets to use the correct API key and authDomain.
