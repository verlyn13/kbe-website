# Sidebar Layout Debug Session Report

## Initial Issues
1. Dashboard content appears underneath/behind the left navigation sidebar
2. When collapsing sidebar, only text disappears but black background pane remains full width
3. Dashboard page content is covered/hidden by the sidebar

## Attempts and Results

### Attempt 1: Fix Dashboard Layout Structure
**Changes:** 
- Removed custom className from SidebarInset
- Cleaned up redundant styling in main content area
- Improved dashboard header z-index
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 2: Add CSS for Layout Conflicts
**Changes:**
- Added sidebar-specific CSS rules in globals.css
- Modified stacking context with position and z-index adjustments
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 3: Change Sidebar from Block to Flex
**Changes:**
- Modified sidebar.tsx line 208: `md:block` â†’ `md:flex`
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 4: Use Inset Variant
**Changes:**
- Added `variant="inset"` to Sidebar component
**Result:** No improvement - removed due to no effect

### Attempt 5: Z-Index Hierarchy Fix
**Changes:**
- Reduced sidebar z-index from z-20 to z-10
- Adjusted header z-index from z-30 to z-20
- Added explicit z-0 to SidebarInset
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 6: Fix Double Main Element
**Changes:**
- Changed inner `<main>` to `<div>` since SidebarInset renders as `<main>`
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 7: Add Layout Classes
**Changes:**
- Added `min-h-screen` and `overflow-hidden` to SidebarInset
- Added `relative min-h-screen` to SidebarProvider
**Result:** No improvement - issue persisted

### Attempt 8: Fix Collapsible Data Attribute
**Changes:**
- Changed `data-collapsible` logic to always show the mode
- Added `shrink-0` to prevent sidebar compression
**Result:** Broke sidebar text display - text disappeared completely

### Attempt 9: Add Complex CSS Fixes
**Changes:**
- Added flexbox rules for sidebar wrapper
- Added text hiding animations for collapsed state
- Added justify-content overrides
**Result:** Page loading became very slow - no layout improvement

### Final Cleanup
**Changes:**
- Removed all custom CSS additions
- Reverted to simple layout structure
- Fixed double main element nesting
- Cleared Next.js build cache
**Result:** Slow loading persists, layout issue remains unchanged

## Current State
- Dashboard content still appears underneath sidebar
- Black background doesn't collapse with sidebar
- Page loading is significantly slower
- Multiple attempted fixes have not resolved the core issue

## Key Observations
1. The shadcn/ui sidebar uses a two-part system: gap reservation div + fixed positioned overlay
2. The gap reservation div appears to work (can grab edge to collapse)
3. The SidebarInset component is not respecting the reserved space
4. Standard shadcn/ui patterns and peer selectors are not functioning as expected
5. Issue persists across multiple approaches suggesting a more fundamental problem

## Solution Implemented (Based on Analysis)
**Root Cause:** The sidebar was using `position: fixed` overlay but expecting push-over behavior. Fixed elements don't affect document flow.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Removed `SidebarInset` component entirely
2. Made sidebar and main content direct siblings in a flex container
3. Applied `margin-left: var(--sidebar-width)` to main content
4. Added useEffect to update `--sidebar-width` CSS variable on collapse/expand
5. Updated tailwind.config.ts to include `margin.sidebar: 'var(--sidebar-width)'`

**Implementation:**
- Sidebar: `fixed inset-y-0 left-0 z-50`
- Main: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto bg-background ml-sidebar`
- CSS variable updates from 16rem (expanded) to 3rem (collapsed)
