# Quick Fix for homerenrichment.com

## The Issue
- Your Next.js app is deployed to **Firebase App Hosting** at: https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app
- Your domain (homerenrichment.com) is connected to **Firebase Hosting** which has no content
- These are two different services!

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Test Authentication First (5 mins)
Before fixing the domain, let's make sure auth works:

1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=kbe-website
2. Click on the Browser API key: `AIzaSyBhTEs3Uxq_KBLBzbzIL2VB4Ao_DBw9faM`
3. Under "Application restrictions", select **"None"** (temporarily)
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Test login at: https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app

### 2. Connect Domain to App Hosting (10 mins)
Once auth works on the App Hosting URL:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kbe-website/apphosting
2. Click on **"kbe-website"** backend
3. Look for "Domains" or "Settings" tab
4. Click **"Add custom domain"**
5. Enter: `homerenrichment.com`
6. Follow the DNS instructions Firebase provides

### 3. Update DNS Records (5 mins + wait time)
Firebase will give you new DNS records. Update these at your domain registrar:
- Delete the old A records (151.101.x.x)
- Add the new ones Firebase provides
- DNS changes can take 1-48 hours to propagate

### 4. Clean Up Old Hosting Site (Optional)
Once the domain is working with App Hosting:
```bash
firebase hosting:sites:delete homerconnect
```

- **Clear Auth State**: https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app/debug-auth-clear

## Why This Happened
The `firebase.json` had a hosting configuration that created a separate Firebase Hosting site. I've already removed this configuration to prevent confusion.
