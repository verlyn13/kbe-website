# FOUND THE ISSUE! Fix OAuth Now

## The Problem
In the Branding tab, the **"Developer contact information"** section is EMPTY.
This is why Google thinks there are "no reachable owners/editors".

## Immediate Fix (2 minutes)

1. On the Branding page you're currently viewing
2. Scroll to the bottom section: **"Developer contact information"**
3. In the **"Email addresses"** field, add: `jeffreyverlynjohnson@gmail.com`
4. Click **"SAVE"** or **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"**
5. Complete any remaining steps if prompted

## After Saving
1. Wait 2-5 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Try signing in with Google at:
   - https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app
   - https://homerconnect.com

## This Should Fix Everything Because:
- ✅ User support email is set correctly
- ✅ App is in production mode
- ✅ Authorized domains are configured
- ❌ Developer contact was missing (now fixed)

## While You're There, Consider Adding:
- **Application home page**: https://homerconnect.com
- **App name**: Change from "project-886214990861" to "Homer Enrichment Hub"

But the critical fix is adding your email to Developer contact information!

## Test Immediately After
The Google sign-in should start working within minutes of adding the developer contact email.
