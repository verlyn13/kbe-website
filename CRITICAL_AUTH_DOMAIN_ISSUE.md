# ~~CRITICAL: Auth Domain Configuration Issue~~ RESOLVED

## Update: Root Cause Was App Check, Not Auth Domain

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - The actual issue was App Check enforcement, not auth domain configuration.

## What We Thought Was Wrong

Initially suspected the Firebase auth domain configuration was causing OAuth failures:

- authDomain: `kbe-website.firebaseapp.com`
- App domain: `homerenrichment.com`

## The Actual Problem

**Firebase App Check in "Enforce" mode was blocking OAuth authentication flows.**

Even with all domains properly configured, App Check enforcement prevents OAuth providers from completing authentication.

## The Solution That Worked

### Set App Check to "Unenforced" Mode

1. Go to Firebase Console → App Check → Apps
2. For Authentication API: Set to "Unenforced"
3. For Cloud Firestore API: Set to "Unenforced"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
5. OAuth authentication works immediately

### Current Working Configuration

- **authDomain**: `kbe-website.firebaseapp.com` (works fine)
- **App Check**: Unenforced mode for Auth and Firestore
- **All domains properly authorized** in Firebase settings
- **API keys** have correct HTTP referrer restrictions

## Lessons Learned

1. **App Check enforcement is incompatible with OAuth providers** in certain configurations
2. **Domain configuration was actually correct** - the auth domain doesn't need to match the app domain
3. **The error message `auth/internal-error` was misleading** - didn't indicate App Check as the cause
4. **Solution was simpler than expected** - just disable App Check enforcement
