# CRITICAL: Fix Project Ownership Issue

## THE PROBLEM
Your Google Cloud project has **"no reachable owners/editors"** which blocks ALL authentication. This is why you're getting the auth blocked error.

## IMMEDIATE FIX

### Option 1: Add Project Owner (Fastest)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=kbe-website
2. Click "GRANT ACCESS" button
3. Add your email address
4. Select role: **"Owner"** or **"Editor"**
5. Click "Save"
6. Authentication should work within 5 minutes

### Option 2: Fix Via Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kbe-website/settings/iam
2. Click "Add member"
3. Add your email
4. Select "Owner" role
5. Save

## WHY THIS HAPPENED
Google requires active project owners/editors for security. When a project has no reachable owners:
- All authentication is blocked
- APIs stop working
- It's a security measure to prevent abandoned projects

## VERIFY THE FIX
After adding yourself as owner:
1. Go back to OAuth consent screen
2. The warning should disappear
3. Try logging in - it should work immediately

## ALSO CHECK
While you're in IAM, make sure these service accounts exist:
- `firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@kbe-website.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- `kbe-website@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`

## TEST IMMEDIATELY
Once you're added as owner, test at:
- https://kbe-website--kbe-website.us-central1.hosted.app
- https://homerenrichment.com

The auth should start working right away!

## Note
This is why even with "no restrictions" on API keys, auth was still blocked - it's a project-level security block, not an API key issue.
